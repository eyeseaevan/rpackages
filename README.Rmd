# rpackages

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rpackages is to complete Coursera's assignment for building R packages.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rpackages from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rpackages")
```

## Example

This is an example showing to to view fatal car accidents in Florida:

```{r example}
library(rpackages)
rpackages::fars_map_state(1,2015)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
